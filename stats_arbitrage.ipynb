    "This notebook is used to explore Statistical Arbitrage\n",
    "\n",
    "We first explain on words what Statistical Arbitrage is, and then explain the stages in implement such strategy. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical Arbitrage is a mean-reversion pair-trading strategy that exploits the statistical relationship between two assets. \n",
    "\n",
    "This two assets should have follow certain statistical relationship, for example highly correlated, and we assume such relationship is norm. This relationship, once disrupted, will supposedly revert to its norm (mean-reversion). \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we implement the most basical stat arb, with two highly correlated & co-integrated assets. The implementation step is as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. load timeseries dataset for asset X and asset Y w/ necessary cleaning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. compute correlation coefficients - confirm that two assets are indeed highly correlated\n",
    "\n",
    "2. test the co-integration, using dicky-fuller test (will talk more on selection of test)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. generate signal when the spread is off by one standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Note*\n",
    "\n",
    "a. By step 2, we will be sure whether the selected pairs are ideal, or that the seires do not cointegrated, thus not being an ideal pair trade\n",
    "\n",
    "b. after we passed the test, we will start generate & monitor trades in step 3"
